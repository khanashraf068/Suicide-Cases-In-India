# Suicide-Cases-In-India
I have downloaded the different dataset from government websites.
It is NCRB Data on suicide.
I have used Power BI for making visualization.
I have made 3 page with different chart on the basis of Male-Female, Age, Profession, Status,Education etc on suicide.
Below is the description and insight of all three pages and the charts.

Page 1

A.Line chart from 2011-2021:                                                                                                                                     

1) We can clearly says that total suicide case has decrease in the year 2013-2014 and 2016-2017 and sudden increase in 2019,2020 and 2021. 2021 has the highest increase rate in 
suicide cases.

2) The suicide cases in male is not fixed there is lot's of up and down's. But there is sudden increase in 2019, and in 2020 it was extremely higher may be beacause it was covid year.

3) The suicide case in female had decreased in 2011-2012 and it was stable from 2012-2019 and sudden increase in suicide case after 2019 just like male.

B. Funnel Chart:(education wise suicide case)

1) 10th class has the highest suicide for both boys and girls but accroding to number of cases boys has nearly 3 times of suicide cases then girls. Diploma/certificate student has very low number of suicide cases then Graduates. So there is a big alarm for education system about the Job related and practical use of study to graduation students.

C.Line chart(Rate of Suicide by year):

1) We have already seen that total number of cases has been increase in 2019, 2020 and 2021.

D.Bar Graph(Causes):

1) Top cause of suicide in male and female are marriage related issuses. And in marriage related issues the number of suicide case in female is higher than male that is very much opposite in other cases.

2) In other top cause of suicides the number of suicide case is much higher or we can say approx 5 times in male than female. But in unemployment cause the male suicide case is 10 times higher than female.

E.Pie Chart(Percentage of Top suicide cause in 2021):

1) Suicide cases due to family problem has the highest percentage i.e 33.2% followed by illness.

A. Group of Pie chart(Age):

1)Pie chart which show age below 18 years is unique then other pie chart. It has high number of suicide case in female then male. It has another prespective that male below 18 years has very low suicide case then other age group.

2) Age above 60 in female has least case of 5k, then below 18 has 7k, then above 30 & below 60 has 15k and then above 18 & below 30 is 24k that is highest. So our conclusion  in 1st point is half wrong and half right. It is concerning that female between 18-30 has very high suicide cases that means young girls facing a huge problem.

3) In male suicide case is very low below 18 years and it is that much low that female suicide cases is also higher then male in these age group. It may be because of Indian Society system where small boys has more accpentance,freedom and caring then female. But male above 18 to below 60 has very higher number of suicide case it may be due to sudden pressure after 18 years on boys put by family and society.

B.Pie chart( Type):

1) Most of the suicide is done by hanging i.e 57% follwed by Poision and Consuming Insecticides.

2) Availability of Posion and insecticide are easy. Government can take strict action on selling this type of liquid product.

3) For suicide done by hanging, most are done on ceiling fan and there is a ceiling fan rod available in market that make alarm noise if extra pressue where put on fan and even the rod has a spring that come's down that help to prevent suicide attempt.

B. Pie chart(Profession)

1) Daily wage earner has highest percentage of suicide in our India, it is due to many issues faced by them especially in covid.

2) Housewife is 2nd largest in suicide it may be of different reason in India, like we have seen that marriage related issues and family problem are the major cause in female suicide cases.
